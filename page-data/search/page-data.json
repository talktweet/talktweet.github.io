But is it so easy?</p>\n<p>Yes, setting up a blog and start blogging is actually very simple.</p>\n<p>But to make money from blogging is not at all an easy task at all. One will need huge knowledge, time to experiment, and skills to write &#x26; convince the audience.</p>\n<p>Due to the technology evolution, you now have seamless options to create a blog. You can check our series of 'Create Superfast blogs' using Gatsby, Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, Next JS, WordPress, and using blogger.</p>\n<p><strong>Before you get to any of those, you must first identify the most profitable blog niches for you.</strong></p>\n<p>Find your knowledge area and write about what you are passionate about. You will defiantly get this great advice from experts when you’re searching for a niche to start your <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/blog\">blog</a>. But, this is not enough. The key to <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/video/307493\">building a successful blog</a> is finding a “profitable” niche.</p>\n<p>Finding the perfect niche is the most crucial and first step of building a blog that often gets overlooked. If you pick a niche with too much competition, your blog will get beaten down by high authority blogs and if you pick a niche with no demand, your blog will barely make an impact and earn anything for you. You should find a niche that’s in the middle and a niche that can also be monetized easily.</p>\n<p>Remember the best formula for a profitable Niche -</p>\n<p><strong>Profitable Niche = No too much competition + Niche in Demand + High-income Potential</strong></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/f4821210a7837ad6b4cd97dac95c7549/2bef9/niche-2-circle-venn-diagram-1.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"best formula to find a profitable Niche\"\n        title=\"best formula to find a profitable Niche\"\n        src=\"/static/f4821210a7837ad6b4cd97dac95c7549/2bef9/niche-2-circle-venn-diagram-1.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/f4821210a7837ad6b4cd97dac95c7549/e85cb/niche-2-circle-venn-diagram-1.png 480w,\n/static/f4821210a7837ad6b4cd97dac95c7549/d9199/niche-2-circle-venn-diagram-1.png 960w,\n/static/f4821210a7837ad6b4cd97dac95c7549/2bef9/niche-2-circle-venn-diagram-1.png 1024w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>In this blog post, we’ll give you practical tips on how to find a profitable niche that can generate traffic and eventually turn into a successful income stream.</p>\n<p>Create an <a href=\"\">excel sheet</a> with the following questions.

Personas are fictional characters that help product managers make these decisions and guide how the team will build features that customers love.</p>\n<p>There are two main types of customer personas — buyers and users. Buyer personas represent the ideal profile of a potential buyer, providing insights about the people who decide to purchase your product or service. User personas represent the people who directly use your product, bringing them to life in a memorable way that everyone can understand. The buyer and user may be the same person — but they will have different priorities based on their user persona and their buyer persona.</p>\n<h2>What is the purpose of user personas?</h2>\n<p>The main purpose of a user persona is to create empathy for customers. Understanding and relating to what matters to your customers is an essential part of <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/product-management\">product management</a>. This requires ongoing research about target user segments so you can build an informed <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/product-roadmap\">roadmap</a>.</p>\n<p>Personas are an effective way to capture and share this research. You can distill the most important attributes of people who use your product — such as their goals, challenges, likes, and dislikes. This information shapes your <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/product-strategy\">product strategy</a> and keeps the entire product team stay focused on creating an outstanding <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/enterprise-transformation/what-is-customer-experience\">customer experience</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are the key benefits of defining user personas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explain the “why” behind product decisions</li>\n<li>Focus on the needs of the most important user groups</li>\n<li>Prioritize features that solve actual user problems</li>\n<li>Implement new functionality in line with how customers will actually use it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to note that there are many types of user personas. For example, if you have a technology product, you might need one persona for the customers who use your product every day and another one for the people who administer your product.</p>\n<h2>How to create user personas</h2>\n<p>This guide describes the steps to create user personas and includes a template for capturing the details.</p>\n<h3>1. Understand who will use your product</h3>\n<p>Personas must be as truthful as possible, so it is important to spend time learning as much as possible about your target users. What is their role? How long have they been in their industry? What are their likes and dislikes? This information helps you envision a typical user and view your product from their perspective.</p>\n<p>The specific details you need to capture will vary based on your industry, market, and type of product. Here are the different types of information that can be useful to gather:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal background: Age, education, and location</li>\n<li>Professional background: Job title, income level, skills, responsibilities, and experience</li>\n<li>Psychographic information: Goals, challenges, likes, and dislikes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can use qualitative and quantitative data to inform your research — such as directly interviewing users, reading support tickets, talking to teams who interact with users, and analyzing product usage.</p>\n<h3>2. Group your typical users</h3>\n<p>You will most likely need to create multiple personas to represent different groups of users. Once you have gathered sufficient data, look for distinct characteristics and behavior patterns. Let’s use an example company called Fredwin Cycling to define a set of user personas. Fredwin Cycling is a social fitness application that connects athletes and promotes friendly competition. Key groups of users might include professional cyclists, casual riders, cycling vendors, and event managers.</p>\n<p>Each group of user personas has a unique set of goals, needs, and wants. Understanding the differences between these groups is essential to guiding how new <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/requirements-management/what-is-a-good-feature-or-user-story-template\">product features</a> are prioritized, designed, and developed.</p>\n<h3>3. Build out a user persona template</h3>\n<p>Now you are ready to build out your personas. Give each one a name and select an image to represent and make your persona memorable. Then, write up an overview that distills the essential elements of their background and preferences.</p>\n<p>Below is an example of a persona we created using the <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/product/strategy#tour-nav\">persona template</a> in Aha! for the Fredwin Cycling company example. The persona is called “Paul: Pro Racer” and describes characteristics of professional cyclists that are relevant to how they interact with a fitness application.</p>\n<p><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" alt=\"product tour strategy persona example\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/4zfc07om50my/6lXQmDOXng2fNT5zG9KKb6/07619f1e96af1ca4dedc0b15596645c4/personas-2020-core.png?w=2000&#x26;q=50\" alt=\"product tour strategy persona example\"></p>\n<p>A key benefit of using software like Aha! is that you can easily collaborate on personas and link them to your work.

Share user personas with the team</h3>\n<p>Once created, share your personas with key members in your organization. Whatever format you choose, it is important to make your personas easily accessible to the entire team.

It’s an unsegmented market which is actually contains everything we see. for example- there are 3 big markets in this world, and they are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Health</li>\n<li>Wealth</li>\n<li>Relationship</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Don’t agree with me?</p>\n<p>Come up with as many popular blogs as you can. <strong>Fitness, weight loss, business, real estate, retirement, dating — all these niches derive from the three core markets.</strong></p>\n<h3>What is Sub-Market?</h3>\n<p>Sub-Market is the category of Market. A market can have many Sub-Markets. For example- Sub-Markets of the <strong>Health Market</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fitness</strong>;</li>\n<li>Weight Loss;</li>\n<li>Supplements;</li>\n<li>Healthy Eating;</li>\n<li>Cures &#x26; Illnesses; and</li>\n<li>and many more</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What is a Niche Market?</h3>\n<p>A niche market is a segment of a larger market that can be defined by its own unique needs, preferences, or identity that makes it different from the market at large. for example-  Niche Market of <strong>Fitness Market:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exercises</li>\n<li>Dieting</li>\n<li>Muscle Tightening</li>\n<li>Body Building</li>\n<li>and many more</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What is Micro Niche?</h3>\n<p>A <strong>Micro Niche</strong> is dedicated to any specific micro-segment of any Niche Market. Nearly every market can be further refined, or divided, by the particular needs and preferences of its constituents. Some of the most common ways to define a niche or micro-niche markets are based on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Price (e.g. luxury, moderate, discount)</li>\n<li>Demographics (gender, age, income level, education level)</li>\n<li>Level of quality (premium, handmade, economical)</li>\n<li>Psychographics (values, interests, attitudes)</li>\n<li>Geographic (residents of a certain country, city, or even neighborhood)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example- Micro Niche Market of <strong>Exercises Market:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yoga</li>\n<li>Gym</li>\n<li>Aerobics</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What is Topic Niche or Keyword Niche? (Bonus Content)</h3>\n<p>I am calling it Topic Niche or Sometimes Keyword Niche. It's a further drill-down of Micro Niche. See an example of <strong>Topic Niche or Keyword Niche.</strong></p>\n<p>For example- Topic/Keyword Niche Market of <strong>Yoga Niche:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vinyasa Yoga</li>\n<li>Hatha Yoga</li>\n<li>Ashtanga Yoga</li>\n<li>Power Yoga</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

Ultimately, it distills the potential of a business down to its essence. It answers fundamental questions about the problem you are going to solve, how you will solve it, and the growth opportunity within a given market.</p>\n<p>Creating a business model is essential, whether you are starting a new venture, expanding into a new market, or changing your <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/blog/marketing-strategy-vs-go-to-market-strategy/\">go-to-market strategy</a>. You can use a business model to capture fundamental assumptions and decisions about the opportunity in one place, setting the direction for success.</p>\n<p>There are many types of business models. Each one varies considerably based on the type of organization and offering. For example, a manufacturing company will have a very different model than an advertising agency. Even within a specific industry, business models vary. Here are a few common business models used by technology companies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subscription</li>\n<li>Transactional</li>\n<li>Freemium</li>\n<li>Affiliate</li>\n<li>Retail sales</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most businesses end up using a combination of business models to reach their customers and grow over time.</p>\n<h2>Why is a business model important?</h2>\n<p>You need a clear path to build something meaningful. The process of building a business model <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/blog/free-business-plan-templates\">establishes a plan</a> for how you will <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/product-strategy/what-are-product-goals-and-initiatives\">realize your vision</a>. It lays out the strategy behind a new undertaking or investment and provides a framework for tracking progress.</p>\n<p>Creating a business model requires deep thought and analysis. Company and product builders must think from the outside in, focusing on market needs and what matters most to customers. Once built, sharing your business model across the organization encourages alignment. This keeps everyone accountable for what they are working on and why, as well as guiding investments of time and resources.</p>\n<h2>How do companies use business models?</h2>\n<p>Companies across every industry and at all stages of maturity use business models. Some rely on lengthy processes and build complicated models, while others move quickly to articulate the basics. Having the discipline to work through this planning tool forces internal alignment.</p>\n<p>For established enterprises, a business model is often a living framework that is reviewed and adapted every year based on changes with customers, employees, and the market. For companies launching new products or entering new markets, a business model can help get them off to the right start and ensure that early product and marketing decisions are tied back to the strategy.</p>\n<h2>What are the components of a business model?</h2>\n<p>A business model should answer important questions about your business and set out a strong vision for the business. The key <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/blog/the-10-main-components-of-a-business-model\">components</a> of a business model should include relating to your target customers, the market, organization strengths and challenges, essential elements of the product, and how it will be sold. Establishing this foundation guides the next planning tool — your <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/product-roadmap\">product roadmap</a>.</p>\n<p>Here is a list of essential components included in a business model:</p>\n<p>| --- | --- |\n| Component | Definition |\n| Vision | High-level introduction to the company and business model |\n| Key objectives | Definition of the top-level goals and how they will be measured |\n| Customer targets and challenges | Description of the different types of customers to be targeted and their pain points |\n| Solution | How the product will solve those pain points |\n| Value | The key characteristics that differentiate the product offering |\n| Pricing | A view into what the solution will cost and how it will be sold |\n| Messaging | Explanation of why the offering will serve a customer’s pain points |\n| Go-to-market | Channels that will be used to reach and sell to customers |\n| Investment required | Costs required to make the solution successful |\n| Growth opportunity | Identified ways the business will grow |</p>\n<h2>What are some examples of business models?</h2>\n<p>Many people associate business models with lengthy documents that describe a company’s problem, opportunity, and solution in the context of a two-to-five-year forecast for costs, growth, and revenue.</p>\n<p>But business models do not need to be a long document. A concise, visual document is an effective way to distill the key elements of your strategy and ensure everyone understands the high-level approach.</p>\n<p>Below are two examples of succinct business model layouts you can use to objectively assess what is possible and what challenges could arise for your business:</p>\n<p><strong>Aha! business model builder</strong></p>\n<p>Articulate the foundation of your product or service in a flexible canvas-style format. The business model developed by Aha! is the most complete template available.

This involves detailing the characteristics that are valued by customers that make it unique. When utilized successfully, product differentiation creates a competitive advantage as customers view your product as superior. You may also hear it referred to as the unique selling proposition, which is the act of advertising or communicating your product differentiation.</p>\n<h2>Why is product differentiation important?</h2>\n<p>It is important for companies to stand out because there are hundreds of new products hitting the market every day. When faced with too many choices, consumers can be overwhelmed and often walk away rather than make a buying decision. That is why it is imperative to find a way for your product to stand out and be considered uniquely valuable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/product-management/what-makes-up-the-product-team\">Product teams</a> strive to make it clear to all customers what their product offers and how it compares to the competition. If your company has multiple products, you also want to make sure each product has a clearly defined identity to eliminate confusion. Creating a differentiated product that appeals to your target market can help to build your competitive advantage over other brands.</p>\n<p>One way to organize the thinking around your product is through the use of a <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/templates/business-plan\">business plan template</a>. Templates can be used to help define your unique value, better understand buyers, and analyze the market — which are just a few of the key areas you need to define when planning how your product will stand out from the competition.</p>\n<p><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAMAAABI111xAAABOGlDQ1BpY2MAAHjaY2BgEkgsKMhhYWBgyM0rKQpyd1KIiIxSYH/CwMnAz8DHwMvAmZhcXOAYEOADVMIAo1HBt2sMjCD6si7IrCsGFw6HzFE9Ihc/42LMRe4vDPgBV0pqcTKQ/gPESckFRSUMDIwJQLZyeUkBiN0CZIsUAR0FZM8AsdMh7DUgdhKEfQCsJiTIGci+AmQLJGckpgDZT4BsnSQk8XQkNtReEOAINbJwNTU3YKA2KEmtKAHRzvkFlUWZ6RklCo7AEEpV8MxL1tNRMDIwAloJCm+I6s9i4HBkFDuFEMt+xMBgac3AwPQZIZYQysCwNYaBgVcbIaY1n4FBMJOB4TB/QWJRItwBjN9YitOMjSBsniIGBtYf//9/lmVgYN/FwPC36P//33P///+7hIGB+SYDw4FCAL0GXej1QJl1AAABO1BMVEXf5uzs7Oy91Ojo7vPx8/T09PTz8/P29vb4+Pju8fLz8vLy8vLr7e7t7/Dw8fP3+Pn19fX39/f7+/v9/f3m6Onn6Onp6+zy8/S4uLi2tra2tre5ubm3t7jGxsbg4ODe3t7j4+Ph4eHm5ufo6Ojt7e3q6ur09PXh7e7h7u7g7e7j7+/b6fPU5fLQ4e/m5OP35Nj66d796t787uXP4ODX5ebY6OnT4uPR39/T4+PP4e3J3e3L4PHf29vo0MHo0cL139Dv18f03c/66Nzp6enbvsfavcbcwMjcwcnbvsbavcXcw8vBuMW+tsK8s8C/t8PAt8S9tMHQytPr6+v6+vr5+fn////x8fHw8PDc38bX2sDl6M7j5s7k587n6tDl6tK00qa21Ki/3bHG4rrE4LfB37PQ5sb8/P3f4uPz9/nyI60nAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAAAB3RJTUUH5AkXDiEcE9+axQAAAHxJREFUCB1VwbEJwkAAQNH/4wkpAiL2aWJroSPcBiKOKThBMoGVrSuorUVIPD1Q8p74hZKZVGo/V/kLpRljYYZheWsKk8HCBMUwNFA5FQrqSy3+DDPD5goL6SK0rzKStK53nvd+YIZhO45V3/FxOJEFktXxTvKMZAGID6bebz4WrLowoXgAAAASdEVYdGV4aWY6RXhpZk9mZnNldAA3OMnUeycAAAAZdEVYdGV4aWY6UGl4ZWxYRGltZW5zaW9uADM4NDAH6KyzAAAAGXRFWHRleGlmOlBpeGVsWURpbWVuc2lvbgAyMTYwO0hJMwAAAFx0RVh0ZXhpZjpVc2VyQ29tbWVudAA2NSwgODMsIDY3LCA3MywgNzMsIDAsIDAsIDAsIDgzLCA5OSwgMTE0LCAxMDEsIDEwMSwgMTEwLCAxMTUsIDEwNCwgMTExLCAxMTZAuB9yAAAAKHRFWHRpY2M6Y29weXJpZ2h0AENvcHlyaWdodCBBcHBsZSBJbmMuLCAyMDIwCrresAAAABd0RVh0aWNjOmRlc2NyaXB0aW9uAFUyOEU1NzDYoY3kAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" alt=\"product differentiation template example\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/4zfc07om50my/1OaXg0h4rbRVhfBktXnaW5/3d20dbc7153621172b646fea3ab4f740/business-model-2020.png?w=2000&#x26;q=50\" alt=\"product differentiation template example\"></p>\n<h2>What are some ways to differentiate your products?</h2>\n<p>You do not want your product to be different just for the sake of being different. Instead, consider what matters most to your customers and let that drive your decisions on how to differentiate. Your product differentiation should arise after carefully <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/templates/competitor-analysis\">researching the competition</a> and should be part of a larger <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/product-strategy/what-is-product-vision\">product vision</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>**Benefits<br>\n**What value can customers expect to gain from using your product compared to others? What problem is the product going to solve? How is it going to make their lives easier and better? For example, your product may be the only solution offering a mobile app that saves time from an activity that parents must do (but do not enjoy doing) every day.</li>\n<li>**Design<br>\n**Does your product have a different design that distinguishes it from others? For example, your product is sleek and has a <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/requirements-management/what-is-user-experience-design\">simple user experience</a>, while your competitors’ offerings appear clunky and dated. This distinction may help customers connect with your brand. Think about the modern design sensibility of the Nest thermostat. Instead of copying the rectangular shape of other thermostats, the company opted for a simple circle with an easy-to-read, color-changing display. Another example is Strava — the run and cycling tracking app. It quantifies something that is hard to track (your workout data) while also building a social community through design. These fresh designs take on old ideas, help companies set their product apart, and gain a competitive advantage.<br>\n<img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/4zfc07om50my/7dKS9Ynkj8blfH9SHVarFC/2d0ad1103da2d32fb2bbfc5650e031e8/product_differentiation_design.23af8ba563875c590fc11634b0288ef5.png%20=1880x1051\"></li>\n<li>**Price<br>\n**Is your product priced lower or higher than your competitors’ products and other products you offer? Your price should reflect the overall value that you offer. For example, you can justify a higher price if customers recognize that your product offers unsurpassed quality. This is how a luxury brand like Ferrari can command a top asking price for their cars. Ask too low of a price, however, and customers may not see your product as truly valuable.</li>\n<li>**Quality<br>\n**Does your product simply work better than your competitors’ products? Do you offer some functionality that your competitors do not? Can users expect the product to last longer than other products? Your product’s competitive advantage may indeed prove to be of superior construction and dependability.</li>\n<li>**Customer service<br>\n**The features of your product may be similar to others in many ways. However, you can differentiate your <a href=\"https://blog.aha.io/7-components-of-your-complete-product-experience/\">Complete Product Experience</a> by assembling a stand-out support team and earning a reputation for being ultra-responsive to customers' needs, requests, and <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/idea-management/how-do-i-prioritize-product-ideas\">ideas</a>.<br>\nFor example, the #1 core value for Zappos is \"deliver wow through service\" and they succeed even though they do not always have the lowest price. A customer who orders by midnight may receive their package the next morning. This emphasis on customer service pays off — judging by the fact that 75% of their sales are reportedly from repeat customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, the way you differentiate your products should not be an arbitrary decision or a reactive response to whatever your competitors are doing. Instead, your product differentiation should arise from a higher-level strategy of <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/product-strategy/what-are-product-goals-and-initiatives\">goals and initiatives</a> specific to your product and your business.</p>"}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"what-is-product-initiative","dateSlug":"2020-09-30","postID":"what-is-product-initiative-2020-09-30"},"frontmatter":{"category":"Product Management","tags":[],"date":"September 30, 2020","format":"image","title":"What is product initiative?","video_link":null,"quote_text":null,"quote_author":null,"link":null,"author":{"name":"Kartik Jhakal"},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/8beef/setting-goals-1.png","srcSet":"/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/d5bac/setting-goals-1.png 6w,\n/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/8beef/setting-goals-1.png 510w,\n/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/1b8c1/setting-goals-1.png 1280w","srcWebp":"/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/47cfc/setting-goals-1.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/ab631/setting-goals-1.webp 6w,\n/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/47cfc/setting-goals-1.webp 510w,\n/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/fadf3/setting-goals-1.webp 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px","presentationWidth":510,"presentationHeight":350}}},"images":null},"excerpt":"Product initiatives Initiatives are high-level efforts that you will complete in order to achieve a goal.

Initiatives can be themes that align to specific priorities in the organization or company (e.g. thought leadership). They might be projects that need to be completed within a specified period of time—even if it is over a few months. Initiatives tend to cross multiple releases or sprints and include many stories or requirements.</p>\n<p>For example, Fredwin Cycling has five initiatives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhance Tour de California coverage</li>\n<li>Launch Giro d’Italia site</li>\n<li>Mobile cycling tracker app upgrades</li>\n<li>Partner self-serve sponsorship portal and API</li>\n<li>Support Galileo GPS system</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we build out our releases and product features for Fredwin Cycling, we link these various initiatives to the work that is being accomplished in our features and releases. In this way, we can track progress over time via our product roadmap and then measure our success against our goals. This helps complete what we call the red thread of strategy throughout our roadmap, and helps us stay in alignment.</p>\n<p>When you think about which initiatives you want to undertake for your company, you may be inundated with ideas. It helps to consider each initiative according to the value that it will add and the effort it will take to accomplish it. This exercise will help you prioritize which initiatives are most valuable and therefore deserve the most attention.</p>"}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"what-is-product-positioning","dateSlug":"2020-09-30","postID":"what-is-product-positioning-2020-09-30"},"frontmatter":{"category":"Product Management","tags":[],"date":"September 30, 2020","format":"image","title":"What is product positioning?","video_link":null,"quote_text":null,"quote_author":null,"link":null,"author":{"name":"Kartik Jhakal"},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/8beef/setting-goals-1.png","srcSet":"/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/d5bac/setting-goals-1.png 6w,\n/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/8beef/setting-goals-1.png 510w,\n/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/1b8c1/setting-goals-1.png 1280w","srcWebp":"/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/47cfc/setting-goals-1.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/ab631/setting-goals-1.webp 6w,\n/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/47cfc/setting-goals-1.webp 510w,\n/static/33cf9f538a43cf3f87c646b74783ad7b/fadf3/setting-goals-1.webp 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px","presentationWidth":510,"presentationHeight":350}}},"images":null},"excerpt":"Positioning is where your product or service fits in the marketplace.

It is a strategic exercise that defines what makes your product unique and why it is better than alternative solutions. Distilling the truth of your product in this way informs your <a href=\"https://blog.aha.io/positioning-vs-messaging/\">messaging</a> so you can effectively explain the value of your offering to potential customers.</p>\n<h2>Why is product positioning important?</h2>\n<p>Your strategic positioning is the basis of your marketing story. The goal is to distill who your audience is, what they need, and how your product can help — all so you can craft messaging that is on target. Establishing upfront how you want your product to be known in the market sets the foundation for how you will communicate the value of your product to customers.</p>\n<p>Your ability to articulate the key benefits of your product and the problem it solves is critical to business success. It keeps your <a href=\"https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/marketing-strategy/what-is-marketing-strategy\">marketing strategy</a> grounded in the true value of what your product provides. This ensures your promotional activities resonate with customers and help them understand why your product is the best option to meet their needs.</p>\n<h2>What influences how a product is perceived?</h2>\n<p>Product positioning is made up of core building blocks that explain your product’s unique value. By bringing together your customer, market, and product knowledge, you can align the broader team around the best way to position your product for success.</p>\n<p>Here are the key elements that define your product positioning:</p>\n<p>| --- | --- |\n| Vision | The overall direction for where your product is headed. |\n| Mission | How you are going to make your vision a reality. |\n| Market category | The market that you are in and your key customer segments. |\n| Tagline | Catchphrase or slogan you use to describe your company or product. |\n| Customer challenges | Major pain points for your customers. |\n| Company and product differentiators | Unique, value-creating characteristics of your company or product. |\n| Brand essence | The core attributes you want to be known for. |</p>\n<p>Here is a template you can download for free to capture the key positioning elements described above for your product or service.</p>\n<p>What is the best way to develop a positioning strategy?\nDeveloping a positioning strategy is a collaborative exercise. It often involves product management and product marketing working closely together to define the core essence of your product. You will need to bring together your knowledge of the following areas:</p>\n<p>Understand the customer\nYour positioning should succinctly capture who your customers are and what they need. Describe the attributes of your target customers, including demographic, behavioral, psychographic, and geographic details. You will also want to provide insights into the main problems the customer is trying to solve. Use your persona profiles to inform your positioning and help the broader team build empathy with your customers.</p>\n<p>Analyze the market\nYou need to know what alternatives customers have to your product so you can highlight what sets your offering apart. Research your direct and indirect competitors to understand how they serve your customers’ needs. This will allow you to differentiate your product from the competition and help you explain to potential customers why your solution is the best option to solve their problems.</p>\n<p>Assess the product\nYour positioning must be built on the unique value your company and product provides. Conducting a SWOT analysis is a useful way to objectively analyze what your product is doing well and where it can do better. This ensures that your marketing message aligns with the product experience, thus helping customers make informed decisions.</p>\n<p>What is a product positioning statement?\nOnce your positioning strategy is defined, create a brief positioning statement that describes your target audience, what sets your product apart, and why customers should care about it. Here is an example of a positioning statement template:</p>\n<p>For [group of users] that [need/want], [company/product] is a [category/solution] that uniquely solves this by [benefit].</p>\n<p>It would be helpful to use an example company to talk through this. Let’s use Fredwin Cycling. The target market is predominantly cycling enthusiasts who are interested in improving their fitness. Your market and customer research reveals that users are concerned about their health but are struggling to stick with an exercise program. Users want to stay motivated by connecting with like-minded friends. The product addresses this need by providing a social cycling community that promotes friendly competition and tracks workout performance.</p>\n<p>Here is a sample positioning statement for Fredwin Cycling:</p>\n<p>For cyclists that want to connect with other athletes, Fredwin Cycling is the leading social fitness application that uniquely brings the cycling community together by promoting healthy competition.\nWhat influences how a product is perceived?\nYour positioning shapes how you want your product to be known in the market. But there are many different factors that can affect how your product is perceived. The major influence is what customers experience when they actually use your product and interact with your company. It is the summation of the Complete Product Experience (CPE) that determines what customers think and feel about your product.</p>\n<p>There are seven core areas that contribute to the CPE:</p>\n<p>Marketing\nHow potential customers learn about your product and decide if it might be a fit.\nSales\nHow prospects get the information they need to make a purchasing decision.\nTechnology\nThe core set of features that customers pay for.\nSupporting systems\nThe internal systems that make it possible to deliver the product.\nThird-party integrations\nThe ecosystem of products the customer uses.\nSupport\nHow customers receive product training and assistance.\nPolicies\nThe rules that govern how your company does business.</p>\n<p>Remember, every touch point with your company either reinforces or undermines your positioning. So, while you should consciously plan how to position your product you should think broadly about every aspect of the adoption process — because your customers will decide what they really think about your product.</p>\n<p>attached excel - positioning template</p>"}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"what-is-product-vision-and-how-to-define-a-product-vision-with-examples","dateSlug":"2020-09-30","postID":"what-is-product-vision-and-how-to-define-a-product-vision-with-examples-2020-09-30"},"frontmatter":{"category":"Product Management","tags":[],"date":"September 30, 2020","format":"image","title":"What is Product Vision and How to define a product vision (with examples)","video_link":"","quote_text":"","quote_author":"","link":"","author":{"name":"Kartik Jhakal"},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/3b1fa2d8071ca426b424da23b0d83138/3866d/julian-fischer-1547748431-last-of-the-pangolins-by-julian-fischer.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3b1fa2d8071ca426b424da23b0d83138/d1bff/julian-fischer-1547748431-last-of-the-pangolins-by-julian-fischer.jpg 6w,\n/static/3b1fa2d8071ca426b424da23b0d83138/3866d/julian-fischer-1547748431-last-of-the-pangolins-by-julian-fischer.jpg 510w,\n/static/3b1fa2d8071ca426b424da23b0d83138/b1c52/julian-fischer-1547748431-last-of-the-pangolins-by-julian-fischer.jpg 1200w","srcWebp":"/static/3b1fa2d8071ca426b424da23b0d83138/47cfc/julian-fischer-1547748431-last-of-the-pangolins-by-julian-fischer.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/3b1fa2d8071ca426b424da23b0d83138/ab631/julian-fischer-1547748431-last-of-the-pangolins-by-julian-fischer.webp 6w,\n/static/3b1fa2d8071ca426b424da23b0d83138/47cfc/julian-fischer-1547748431-last-of-the-pangolins-by-julian-fischer.webp 510w,\n/static/3b1fa2d8071ca426b424da23b0d83138/5d3c8/julian-fischer-1547748431-last-of-the-pangolins-by-julian-fischer.webp 1200w","sizes":"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px","presentationWidth":510,"presentationHeight":350}}},"images":null},"excerpt":"Before starting any product, we should have a clear vision of where to take your product and how it's going to be in the end state.

An effective product vision inspires the development team and stakeholders. A product vision isn’t a detailed plan that explains how to reach the goal. Its just a skeleton provide you a high level view of your product or services.</p>\n<h3>What is Product Vision?</h3>\n<p>The product vision should act as a “north star” for all product development. It can set the direction for where a product will go or the end state a product will deliver in the future. A product vision represents the core essence of the product and answers the following core questions. </p>\n<p>1- What problem product is solving? </p>\n<p>2- What is the purpose of creating a product? </p>\n<p>3- What change your product will bring? </p>\n<p>4- What benefits your customers will have? </p>\n<p>5- What a product going to be in the end state?</p>\n<p>The process of defining a product vision statement allows all of the project stakeholders to visualize the product in context and not as a catalog of features and design efforts. To develop a product vision statement, you start with the end-user and define:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What problem product is solving? ?</li>\n<li>Who is the audience you are solving the problem for?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Next, you evaluate the specific job to be done:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the purpose of creating a product? </li>\n<li>What change your product will bring? </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Last, you outline your deliverables:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What benefits your customers will have? </li>\n<li>What a product going to be in the end state?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Essentially, drafting a product vision statement is a method for evaluating and appraising every design decision in context with both the needs of the business and the end-user. It also builds out the connection between user experience design and product management.</p>\n<h3>Why is A Product Vision Statement Important?</h3>\n<p>There are significant advantages to creating a product vision statement:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A vision statement explicitly defines who will be using the product.</li>\n<li>A vision statement expresses the solution to the problem those users are facing.</li>\n<li>A vision statement differentiates the product from what currently exists in the market.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A product vision statement establishes a definite area of focus for product, which helps businesses set specific success criteria and clear objectives to determine what features the product needs to be successful.</p>\n<h3>What information Product Vision should have?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The most important part of any business is customers, whether they are B2B or B2C.  It's the most important part of the Vision Statement.</li>\n<li>It should state crisp and clear product Goals.</li>\n<li>Goals should include motivation behind it.</li>\n<li>A clear and catchy statement that inspires the team and audience</li>\n<li>It would be better if have realistic and ambitious time constraints or time frame.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Product Vision and Company Vision</h3>\n<p>There is a difference between a product and company vision. Product Vision is crucial for business as this is the foundation for further steps that will come in product development. These steps are-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product Strategy</li>\n<li>Product Roadmap</li>\n<li>Product Backlog</li>\n<li>Development process</li>\n<li>Delivery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Company visions are often too broad to be good product visions. Company visions are also usually meant to be customer-facing marketing messages, while product visions are internal messages that align your team.</p>\n<h4>Example 1</h4>\n<p>Amazon’s company vision is:</p>\n<p><em>To be earth’s most customer-centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online.</em></p>\n<p>That’s a compelling vision for Amazon as a company, and you could argue is relevant for the Kindle. It is a device where you can buy any book you want online and begin reading it immediately.</p>\n<p>While the Kindle’s vision isn’t publicly available, there is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/17/7396525/amazon-kindle-design-lab-audible-hachette\"><strong>a great interview</strong></a> with some of its leaders from a few years ago. In it, they say, “paper is … the inspiration for the Kindle of the future: a weightless object that lasts more or less forever and is readable in any light. “Paper is the gold standard.”</p>\n<p>This is a specific vision for what they think the vision of the experience using the Kindle should be. It definitely hits all four principles.</p>\n<h4>Example 2</h4>\n<p>Lets check another example of Google-</p>\n<p>and Google's corporate vision is “<strong><em>to provide access to the world’s information in one click</em></strong>.” </p>\n<p>Google’s most popular product is its search engine service. This product enables people to easily access information from around the world. but if talk about some of the other products of Google like, Google Business Suit, Android, Chrome etc. are not directly based on this statement.  Let’s have a look at the product vision for Google Calendar. The team realized in about 2006 that no other company offered a great calendar product and experience. Therefore, the team came up with a simple 4 point vision:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fast, visually appealing, and joyous to use</li>\n<li>Drop-dead simple to get information into the calendar</li>\n<li>More than boxes on a screen (reminders, invitations, etc.)</li>\n<li>Easy to share so you can see your whole life in one place</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It contains no detailed explanation on a feature level, although the goal is clear. It may not be sexy, but it helped the team to build the most popular calendar application on the planet.</p>\n<h4>Example 3</h4>\n<p>Many companies create more than one product. For example, Google has many products such as Gmail, Google Search, Google Drive, Google Maps, Chrome browser, Adwords, and many many more. Google probably has around 20,000 developers which means that they have hundreds if not thousands of tech teams. Each team needs to have a vision for its particular product.</p>\n<p>Google's company-wide vision statement is to provide access to the world’s information in one click.</p>\n<p>However, the product vision statement for the Google Maps product might be something like to organize and make accessible an experience that highlights what matters most to each user who wants to find geographical information and make journeys with maximum ease.</p>\n<h3>How to define Product Vision - Product Vision Statement Template</h3>\n<p>For me vision creation is of basically two parts.</p>\n<p>1- Research</p>\n<p>2- Combining all research to a one Vision statement</p>\n<h4>1- Research</h4>\n<p>Before defining a product vision, it’s important to have some valid data. The whole product discovery process is obviously a great way to get data and find answers to open questions. Without the data, it doesn’t make sense to define a vision for the next couple of years. It’s, however, important to remind ourselves that a product vision needs to be regularly challenged, evaluated, and updated based on new data.</p>\n<p>According to <strong>Roman Pichler’s</strong> product vision board, it’s important to answer 4 key questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What’s the target group?</li>\n<li>What are the customer needs?</li>\n<li>What is and will be the product and it’s USP(s)?</li>\n<li>What are the business goals?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Alternatively, you can work with other models, e.g. the lean business model canvas focusing on the product. What’s most important is gaining a clear picture of your customer, your market, the problems you want to solve, and your business goals. You can build a product vision based on that.</p>\n<h4>2- Combining all research to a one Vision statement</h4>\n<p>Author Geoffrey Moore offers a useful format in his seminal book <em>Crossing the Chasm</em>. It can be used by marketers to create a positioning statement or by product managers to create an effective product vision statement:</p>\n<p>For <strong>[our target customer],</strong> who <strong>[customer’s need],</strong> the <strong>[product]</strong> is a <strong>[product category or description]</strong> that <strong>[unique benefits and selling points].</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike <strong>[competitors or current methods],</strong> our product <strong>[main differentiators].</strong></p>\n<h5>Email App Product Vision Example</h5>\n<p><strong><em>For</em></strong> business e-mail users</p>\n<p><strong><em>who</em></strong> want to better manage the increasing number of messages they receive when out of the office</p>\n<p><strong><em>our product</em></strong> Email App</p>\n<p><strong><em>is a</em></strong> mobile e-mail solution that provides a real-time link to their desktop e-mail for sending, reading, and responding to important messages.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Unlike</em></strong> other mobile e-mail solutions,</p>\n<p><strong><em>Email App</em></strong> is secure, autosysnc, and always connected. </p>\n<p>At this point, hopefully, you’ve identified what’s special about your product and why your target market needs it. Now you can use these key points—and the template above—to draft a compelling statement.</p>\n<p>There are few more templates you can use-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We believe (in) a [<strong>noun:</strong> world, time, state, etc.] where [<strong>persona</strong>] can [<strong>verb:</strong> do, make, offer, etc.], for/by/with [<strong>benefit/goal</strong>].</li>\n<li>To [<strong>verb:</strong> empower, unlock, enable, create, etc.] [<strong>persona</strong>] to [<strong>benefit, goal, future state</strong>].</li>\n<li>Our vision is to [<strong>verb:</strong> build, design, provide], the [<strong>goal, future state</strong>], to [<strong>verb:</strong> help, enable, make it easier to...] [<strong>persona</strong>].</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The great thing about a product vision statement is that it also doubles as an <em>elevator pitch</em>.

Originally initiated by Intel and successfully implemented at Google and LinkedIn, more and more companies recognize and take advantage of the benefits OKRs offer. OKRs is now one of the <a href=\"https://www.workpath.com/magazine/der-okr-community-report-2018-erste-einblicke/\"><strong>leading tools</strong></a> to boost self-managed, high-performing teams and support an organization's transformation to become (more) responsive.</p>\n<h4>What is OKRs?</h4>\n<p>OKRs is the acronym for objective and key results—more specifically, an objective is tied to key results. In a simplest definition, an Objective tells you where to go, and a Key Result will let you know whether you’re there or not at the end of a work. The OKRs provide a reference to evaluate how well you did in executing your objectives.</p>\n<h4>What is an Objective?</h4>\n<p>An Objective is a goal to be achieved in the future. An Objective sets a clear direction and provides motivation. An Objective will clearly tell you \"Where to go?\" or \"What is the destination?\"</p>\n<p>Think of it as a destination on the map where you want to go, for example - To New Cafe! or London! or to your office!.</p>\n<p>The objective can be anything. Let's check an example.</p>\n<p>Example: Launch new product, Generate more revenue, Increase Traffic on your website, create more articles for the blog, etc..</p>\n<h4>What is a Key Result?</h4>\n<p>A Key Result is a metric with an initial value and a target value that measures progress towards an Objective or Goal. A Key Result is like a progress card that shows how close you are to your Objective.</p>\n<p>A Key result defined by you along with Goals that contains specific values or numbers that clearly define your goals into measurable units.</p>\n<p>Example: Increase development resources assigned to innovation from 15 to 30%, Achieve a market valuation of $500,000,000, Get featured by Apple on the App Store,</p>\n<h4>What is an Initiative?</h4>\n<p>An Initiative is simply the work you’ll do to influence a Key Result. If an Objective is your destination and a Key Result shows the distance to go, an Initiative describes \"What you’ll do to get there?\" or \"How you will achieve the Goal?\"</p>\n<p>Example: Create a new sales team, Hire an app store optimization agency, Collaborate with the third party marketing agency</p>\n<h4>OKRs Template</h4>\n<p>Although OKR is a mindset and you don't need a template else you can create your own structure as per your use case. To start, you can use these simple templates to define, track, and align your OKRs.</p>\n<p>Free templates from <a href=\"https://www.smartsheet.com/content/okr-templates\">SmartSheets Company</a> -</p>\n<p>Free excel templates from <a href=\"https://weekdone.com/resources/templates/okr-report-spreadsheet-template?utm_campaign=https://blog.weekdone.com/okr-templates-examples-how-to-write-great-objectives-and-key-results-free-excel-and-word-templates/&#x26;utm_source=blog.weekdone.com&#x26;utm_content=blogcontent\">Workdone</a></p>\n<p>Free word template from <a href=\"https://weekdone.com/resources/templates/okr-report-document-template?utm_campaign=https://blog.weekdone.com/okr-templates-examples-how-to-write-great-objectives-and-key-results-free-excel-and-word-templates/&#x26;utm_source=blog.weekdone.com&#x26;utm_content=blogcontent\">Workdone</a></p>\n<h4>OKRs Example</h4>\n<p><strong>Company OKR 2:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Objective: Increase brand recognition and awareness</li>\n<li>Key Result 1: Increase media engagement by 20%</li>\n<li>Key Result 2: Launch customer referral program by Jan 1</li>\n<li>Key Result 3: Extend social media reach and visibility to two new target markets</li>\n<li>Key Result 4: Expand thought leadership program by placing guest articles on four industry-related sites with an Alexa ranking of at least 30,000</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Marketing Team OKR:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Objective: Increase social media engagement by 35%</li>\n<li>Key Result 1: Research and identify three most popular social media sites among two new target audiences and develop engagement strategy by Jan 1</li>\n<li>Key Result 2: Participate in six Twitter chats involving industry leaders</li>\n<li>Key Result 3: Respond to new Facebook comments within three hours</li>\n<li>Key Result 4: Increase number of followers on Facebook and Twitter by 20%</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Individual OKR:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Objective: Increase number of social media connections by 25%</li>\n<li>Key Result 1: Increase posting frequency on Twitter to 8x daily and Facebook to 3x daily</li>\n<li>Key Result 2: Establish social media presence on two new sites: LinkedIn and Quora</li>\n<li>Key Result 3: Join 5 LinkedIn groups with at least 2,500 members each and leave comments on the 10 most popular discussions in each group</li>\n<li>Key Result 4: Gain 15 followers on Quora by posting three answers and one question every week</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Objective</strong> – Improve Our Testing Procedure</h3>\n<p><strong>Key Result 1</strong>: Implement test driven development in 3 new development teams</p>\n<p><strong>Key Result 2</strong>: Increase unit test coverage to 75% of code</p>\n<p><strong>Key Result 3</strong>: Make sure satisfaction score of product management to testing team is at least 7.5</p>\n<p><strong>Key Result 4</strong>: Increase time spent on reviewing codes by 20 minutes each day</p>\n<h3><strong>Objective</strong> – Reduce Time Taken To Test New Feature</h3>\n<p><strong>Key Result 1</strong>: Automate 70% of regression tests executed in a feature pull request</p>\n<p><strong>Key Result 2</strong>: Run regression tests in parallel to reducing execution time to max 0.5 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Key Result 3</strong>: Maintain records of new automated tests to be implemented before the start of a new project</p>\n<p><strong>Objective 1</strong>: <strong><em><del>Launch a blockbuster product by end of FY 2017-18</del></em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Key results</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>40% increase in pre-bookings for new product by Q3 FY 2017-18</li>\n<li>70% increase in inquiries about new product, every quarter</li>\n<li>60% demos given to prospects converted to negotiation stage by Q4 FY 2017-18</li>\n</ol>\n<p>OKRs Tools</p>\n<h4>OKRs as a communication framework</h4>\n<p>As you might have guessed by now, effective OKRs are widely shared and meant to be understood by teams and individuals.</p>\n<p>In that regard, they can serve as a communication framework for directing groups to solve complex challenges with constraints. As a communication tool, OKRs bring two key things to an organization:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easily digestible direction such that every member in the organization understands how they contribute to the mission; aka focus</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Expectations amongst teams and their individual members; aka accountability</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Defining measurable results becomes easier as you learn what you should be measuring and what ultimately matters for your business. In my work with founders <strong>I find that the quality of OKRs has a good correlation with their understanding of their business.</strong> Blindly going for growth without understanding the reasons behind specific metrics (revenue drivers, hypothesis testing) can be damning.</p>\n<p>I began to use the OKR framework to help my friends’ startups, which varied in size from 4–100+ people, because of the tool’s practicality and straightforwardness. I found my friends running into two challenges as their companies grew:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What should we do next — and how do we know if it’s working?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>What is an effective way to align the organization towards a common goal? (aka: better direction setting)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the first scenario OKRs forces the measurement of any company endeavor. Ideally this optimizes the input efforts because things that are working will be continued (and grow in scope), while the areas that get dropped or do not work well will be reevaluated or canned.</p>\n<p>In the second scenario, which is notoriously hard to do well, OKRs provide a framework to explain the company’s goal(s) and provide enough objectives that can be broken down into smaller components for the many teams involved in making it a reality. The better you can state your goals the easier your teams can figure out what needs to happen and how to get there.</p>\n<p>This may seem simplistic — too good to be true, but I’ve found just going through the exercise of either defining OKRs, or reworking current company plans into OKRs to be a highly effective evaluation tool.</p>\n<p>OKRs aim to align employee performance and efforts to business goals. This helps drive a shared responsibility of the (teams) results. OKRs help to explain the purpose of work and set everyone’s focus on delivering value. When successfully implemented they:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>support employees creativity,</li>\n<li>increase their motivation and commitment,</li>\n<li>enable self-management and improve willingness to take ownership and</li>\n<li>foster innovation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The OKR method provides a clear concept, various best practices and software supporting tools are available. But frequently, companies struggle to implement this agile method appropriately or even miss-use it actively as a top-down management to-do list tracking tool.</p>\n<p>OKR feedback surveys we ran in our client projects showed that the top challenges the teams faced were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a lack of trust and handover of responsibility from the management towards the teams,</li>\n<li>transparency of OKR process (definition, monitoring and relation to the company’s goals),</li>\n<li>a disconnect between the defined objectives and the actual work the team needs to do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the other hand, the teams confirmed that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they were confident in understanding the OKR’s concept and procedure,</li>\n<li>and believed generally in the sense of purpose and chance of success (by correct process implementation).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These results led to the question: How to release the full potential of the OKR method?</p>\n<p>We believe the first step is to identify areas of improvement. For that, you must start talking to all the people involved.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1408454471","2404490943","2661970575","3704789613","3904292974","399170485","493794765","63159454","850277546"]}
